        <p>
          My Dearest Kiran,<br><br>

          I don’t know if I deserve to be writing this to you — not after everything.<br>
          But today is your birthday… and no matter how far apart we are, I couldn’t stay silent.<br><br>

          <strong>Happy Birthday, Kiran. 💫</strong><br>
          From the bottom of my heart, I wish you peace, joy, and all the love this world can offer — even if I’m not the one by your side today.<br><br>

          I’ve been thinking about you every single day.<br>
          Not just about the beautiful memories we made — but also the mistakes I made, the pain I caused.<br>
          And it hurts deeply to know I added weight to your heart when all I ever wanted was to make it feel light, safe, and full of love.<br><br>

          You didn’t deserve the words I spoke out of fear.<br>
          I was overwhelmed by the thought of losing you… and instead of holding on with patience, I reacted with pain.<br>
          I understand now how much those words may have scared you or pushed you away. And for that, I am truly, deeply sorry.<br><br>

          You were never just “someone” in my life — you were my calm, my smile, my person.<br>
          Even now, you still are.<br><br>

          I miss the late-night talks, the random laughter, the way your eyes lit up when you talked about the things you loved — especially K-dramas and that soft smile you'd have when watching V.<br>
          You have a way of loving things so deeply and beautifully… and I wish I had protected your heart better.<br><br>

          <strong>Kiran, I still love you — more than I’ve ever loved anything in this world.</strong><br>
          Not out of desperation… but from a place of deep respect and warmth.<br>
          I’ve changed, and I’m still growing — for you, for me, for us if there’s ever an “us” again.<br><br>

          Even in silence, I’ve been rooting for your smile. I’ve replayed the sound of your voice in quiet moments, wishing I had held it longer.<br>
          I’ve carried your laugh in my mind like my favorite song — soft, familiar, and unforgettable.<br><br>

          I know I can’t undo the past, but I believe in second chances — not to relive old pain, but to build something softer, more honest, more real.<br><br>

          So if even the smallest part of your heart still remembers the love we shared — I hope one day, when you're ready, we can talk again.<br>
          No pressure. No expectations. Just two people who once meant everything to each other, finding their way back — maybe not to the same place, but to something new.<br><br>

          No matter where life leads you, I hope the stars are always kind to you.<br>
          And if ever, even for a second, you look at the moon and think of me — know that I’m doing the same.<br><br>

          Until then, I’ll be quietly cheering for your happiness, always.<br>
          Because even if you’re not mine anymore… you’ll always hold a place in my heart.<br><br>

          With all the love I have,<br>
          <strong>Samadhan</strong>
